# Computer-Science-IB Program (High School)
**Majority of the exercises and projects were are from Blue Pelican Java by Charles Emerson Cook and Big Java by Cay S. Horstmann

**Computer Science 201 (Object-Based Programming Fundamentals):**
- Systematic class design using a subset of UML (Unified Modelling Language), test driven development, debugging and error handling are introduced. Recursion, inheri-tance and polymorphism

**Computer Science 202 (Object-Oriented Design and UML):**
- Systematic class design using a subset of UML (Unified Modelling Language), test driven development, debugging and error handling are introduced. Recursion, inheri-tance and polymorphism get demystified.

**Computer Science 301 (Dynamic Data Structures & File Handling):**
- Each structure is presented in the context of the standard Java collections library using iterators, sets and maps. Students also learn to implement their own structure classes. Java’s AWT and Swing classes are applied.

**Computer Science 302 (Applying Algorithms To Problem Solving):**
- Students are guided through ever more challenging problems of different "types" categorized by solution: sorting, shortest path, approximate, random, compression, maximum flow, sequence comparison, etc.

**Computer Science 31-IB (Dynamic Data Structures & File Handling):**
- Each structure is presented in the context of the standard Java collections library using iterators, sets and maps. Students also learn to implement their own structure classes. Java’s AWT and Swing classes are applied.
-IB Dossier at either the IB Computer Science Standard Level or Higher Level.
- Dossiers document the use of UML (Unified Modelling Language) diagrams, Javadoc comments, exception handling, unit testing.
